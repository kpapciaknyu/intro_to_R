## On Your Own Work

>- When you read in a .csv file into R, what class is the object that you read in (like nyc)?

"data.frame"

>- What command can you use to determine what type of data is in a column?

```{r}
nyc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredlapolla/RVilcekMaster23/master/NYC_HANES_DIAB.csv")
class(nyc$SPAGE) # class(df$column)
```


>- Provide a command to find the type of data in the DX_DBTS column of nyc. 

```{r}
class(nyc$DX_DBTS)
```


>- Provide the same command the type of data but use the other way of indexing from what you did above. 

```{r}
class(nyc['DX_DBTS'])
```



>- What would happen if we had chosen the first 4 columns of NYC HANES and made a matrix? What would the class of the cells in this matrix be? Why?

```{r}
nyc_new<-data.frame(nyc$KEY,nyc$GENDER,nyc$SPAGE,nyc$AGEGROUP)
class(nyc_new)
# It would still be a data frame because there is still a rectangular array of numbers with rows and columns, only difference is this matrix has less columns than the original "nyc" and only consist of "integer" columns.

```


>- If we make a vector,vec<- c(3,9,4,7,8,9), and multiply it by WannaMatrix, what is the value in the third row, third column? 

```{r}
WannaMatrix <- nyc[5:10, 6:9]
WannaMatrix <- as.matrix(WannaMatrix,nrow = 6, ncol = 4)

print(WannaMatrix[3,3])


```



>- What happens if instead we made a vector vec2 <- c(3,9,4,7,8) and multiply it by WannaMatrix, what is the third row, third column value? What is going on? 

```{r}
vec2 <- c(3,9,4,7,8)
vec2*WannaMatrix
# R wasn't able to run the code because there is a difference in length of vectors between the two
length(vec2)
length(WannaMatrix)
```


>- Look up the arguments for read.csv

```{r}
?read.csv
# read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"", dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...)
```


>- Use apply() to find the median value of CADMIUM, LEAD CHOLESTEROLTOTAL, GLUCOSESI, CREATININESI, and CREATININE

```{r}
apply(nyc[c('CADMIUM', 'LEAD','CHOLESTEROLTOTAL', 'GLUCOSESI', 'CREATININESI','CREATININE')], 2, median, na.rm = T)
```


>- Do the same using sapply()

```{r}
sapply(nyc[c('CADMIUM', 'LEAD','CHOLESTEROLTOTAL', 'GLUCOSESI', 'CREATININESI','CREATININE')], median, na.rm = T)
```


>- Use a for loop to find the median value of columns 16:19

```{r}
column_indices <- c(16:19)
medians <- numeric(length(column_indices))
for (i in 1:length(column_indices)) 
{
  column_index <- column_indices[i]
  medians[i] <- median(nyc[, column_index], na.rm = TRUE)
}
print(medians)
# Used GPT to help with this code, I tried a simpler for loop but it did not work.
```


>- Make a for loop to find the standard deviation (hint sd() ) of CHOLESTEROLTOTAL, GLUCOSESI, CREATININESI, AND CREATININE

```{r}
column_indices <- c(16:19)
std_devs <- numeric(length(column_indices))
for (i in 1:length(column_indices)) 
{
  column_index <- column_indices[i]
  std_devs[i] <- sd(nyc[, column_index], na.rm = TRUE)
}
print(std_devs)
```


>- Bonus/Challenge Create a vector in which to put the standard deviations 

```{r}
# I did this above I believe
```


>- Use ifelse to create a new variable of high and normal A1C dichotomizing with 7 as a threshold for high levels

```{r}

```


>- Subset to only have females (gender == "female")

```{r}

```


>- Create a subset of males and find the median total cholesterol level

```{r}

```


>- Try to create a summary of the mean A1C using two factors, GENDER and DX_DBTS

```{r}

```

Find the class of the first three columns of data. What are they?

```{r}

```
